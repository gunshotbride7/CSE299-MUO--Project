# CSE299-MUO-Project

Name: HealthX

Description:

HealthX is a web-based healthcare system, built to address the issue of connectivity and fast response. The main motivation behind this was to build a system through which anyone can receive medication and consultation online as well as can order medicines. It is a system where anyone can store their medical history so that it can be later used for further diagnosis of any patients. The system also holds a doctors section through which doctors can signup and check if they have any upcoming appointments or not, they can also check a patient's medical history while diagnosing during an appointment can suggest a proper medication or solution based on that.
